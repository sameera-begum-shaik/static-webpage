            A dress is a garment predominantly worn by women or girls consisting of a skirt with an attached bodice. It consists of a top piece that covers the torso and hangs down over the legs. A dress can be any one-piece garment containing a skirt of any length, and can be formal or casual. 
           fashion is about self-expression not status
           Fashion is about how you dress and style yourself. It's a way to show your personality without saying a word. Some people like to follow trends, while others create their own style. Fashion is not just clothes; it's also accessories like bags, shoes, and even hairstyles. It changes a lot, what's popular today might not be popular next year. But that's what makes it exciting. You can experiment and find what makes
you feel good.
