 Ecommerce stands for “electronic commerce” and refers to a digital platform, and a business model, where you can buy or sell products online. Every time you purchase a product online, you’re participating in the ecommerce economy.
 The term is quite broad and flexible, as it not only includes physical product sales from sites like Amazon or eBay, but online banking, software services, remote service providers, or online course platforms (basically, any transaction made online). Usually it is possible to judge from context, however, in the absence of other information, the term “ecommerce” is most usually used to refer to typical online equivalents of physical stores, for example a website that sells shirts to end consumers.
thank you for choosing or E-commerce company
